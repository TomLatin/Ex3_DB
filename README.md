NoSQL
Welcome to my read me!

This work was done as part of a database course and it deals with the subject NoSQL.
I have worked with several different databases and according to them their query languages:
* mongoDB
* Neo4j
* SPARQL and RDF

Other topics that were at work:
* TF-IDF
* Stream
* xQuery

I invite you to download it to your work environment and try to solve the exercises, of course you can compare with my answers :)
